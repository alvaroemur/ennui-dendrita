Project management and business operations system adapted from infrastructure best practices, designed specifically for managing multiple business operations projects.

The coordinating center of the work ecosystem is a dendrite that integrates information into structured decisions and actions.

---

## 🙏 Acknowledgments & Credits

**ennui-dendrita** is inspired by and adapted from the [**Claude Code Infrastructure Showcase**](https://github.com/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase) project, which provided the foundational patterns and infrastructure concepts that made this system possible.

The original project, developed over 6 months of real-world use managing complex TypeScript microservices, solved critical problems like automatic skill activation and scalable AI-assisted development. We adapted these patterns to create a methodology focused on business operations, project management, and multi-workspace coordination.

**Key adaptations:**
- Adapted `.claude/` infrastructure patterns to `.dendrita/` for business context
- Transformed development-focused skills into business operation methodologies
- Extended the workspace concept to support multiple companies/organizations
- Added project-specific structures (`master_plan.md`, `current_context.md`, `tasks.md`)
- Integrated domain-specific knowledge (sustainability, MEL, fundraising, stakeholder management)

**Original Work:**

We are grateful to the original developers for sharing these patterns and making this adaptation possible.

## 🌟 Philosophy & Vision

### Bridging the Gap: From No-Code to Hybrid-Code

**ennui-dendrita** was created with a clear intention: to close the gap for people who don't know how to program or only dare to use no-code tools.

Once you understand:
- **Code logic** (ability to write pseudo-code)
- **Basic nomenclature** (understanding what variables, functions, and files mean)
- **A lot of curiosity** (the desire to learn and experiment)

...you can make things happen with a **hybrid of code and a very organized way of working**.

**Anyone can use a system like this.**

### Who This Is For

If someone looks at this and thinks "this is garbage," they might be looking at it with "programmer eyes" (or maybe I'm pre-judging). 

**This is NOT a repository for programmers** (or at least not directed at them). It's for everyone else who always thinks that knowing how to use tools like Docs, Sheets, Slides, any Office suite tool, email, and other things from consultative life or professional life in general with skill is something for nerds.

We want someone like them to **"dare" to download Cursor** (something they probably don't know, or if they do, they see it as an alien tool) and **pay for a $20 monthly account** to have the best productivity tool of their life.

**If you already use ChatGPT for everything, imagine what you could do if you already had all the context at your disposal.**

> "Look at the proposal Daniel asked me for and check if it meets the objectives Angela told me about"

...becomes not just an ephemeral wish, but a **powerful actionable phrase**.

### Building a Community & Methodology

We hope this is seen as that and to generate a **community of people who build a WORK METHODOLOGY, a way of operating** (and also make applications on top of this, why not?).

This is not just about tools—it's about **developing a systematic approach to work** that combines:
- The power of AI-assisted development
- The structure of well-organized documentation
- The flexibility of a methodology that adapts to your context
- The community knowledge that emerges from shared practices

## 📅 Development Timeline

**Follow dendrita's evolution in real time**

The [Development Timeline](.dendrita/blog/posts/dev-timeline.md) documents all changes to dendrita infrastructure as "tweets" in first person. Every modification to hooks, skills, agents, and scripts is automatically registered, creating a communication channel where dendrita documents its own evolution.

## 🎯 What is this?

**ennui-dendrita** is a system and methodology for managing multiple projects in parallel, maintaining continuity between sessions and applying best practices consistently. It's adapted for business operations and project management, integrating structured documentation, specialized agents, and reusable templates.

- ✅ **Manage multiple projects simultaneously** without losing track
- ✅ **Maintain continuity between sessions** (docs-as-code)
- ✅ **Apply best practices** automatically based on project type
- ✅ **Report and document** systematically and consistently
- ✅ **Orchestrate teams and partners** with clarity and governance

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Create your workspace:** `workspaces/[your-company]/`
2. **Create a project:** `workspaces/[your-company]/🚀 active-projects/[your-project]/`
3. **Add the 3 base files:**
   - `master-plan.md` (master plan)
   - `current-context.md` (living context)
   - `tasks.md` (tasks)
4. **Use templates from** `.dendrita/templates/workspace-template/` based on project type
5. **Keep `current-context.md` updated** after important decisions

**If using this repo as a template:**
- Update `LICENSE` with your organization's information
- Define style in `workspaces/[your-company]/config-estilo.json`
- Customize `.dendrita/settings.json` with your project metadata

**For general business management:** Use `⚙️ company-management/` for topics that don't belong to a specific project (strategic planning, HR, process improvement, financial planning).

```

**Important notes:**
- Each workspace can define its `config-estilo.json` (naming and writing conventions)
- Active projects must have: `master-plan.md`, `current-context.md`, `tasks.md`
- Maintain consistency with `workspaces/[company]/📚 best-practices/`

---

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### 1. Initiation
- Create project folder and the 3 base files
- Review the project type template in `📚 best-practices/`

### 2. Execution
- Review `current-context.md` at the start of each session
- Update tasks and key decisions
- Activate agents from `.dendrita/users/[user-id]/agents/` when you need specialized methodologies

### 3. Completion
- Complete final reports
- Archive the project (move to `.archived-projects/`)
- Document learnings in `📚 best-practices/`

---

## 📚 Persistent Documents System

- **`master-plan.md`**: Executive summary, phases, metrics, timeline, risks
- **`current-context.md`** (update frequently): Progress, decisions, blockers, next steps
- **`tasks.md`**: Checklist by phases, status, acceptance criteria, responsible parties
- **`project-context.json`** ⚠️ UPDATE FREQUENTLY: Combines all above into a single JSON

---

## 🧩 Best Practices (Examples)

Review `.dendrita/templates/workspace-template/📚 best-practices/` for examples of:
- Fundraising Bootcamp
- Sustainability Diagnostic (Phase 1)
- Project and Alliance Pipeline
- MEL System (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning)
- Sustainability Implementation (Phases 2-4)

---

## 🤖 Agents and Work Modes

Activate agents by loading files in `.dendrita/users/[user-id]/agents/` as needed (sustainability strategy, project management, MEL analysis, stakeholder management, fundraising).

General work preferences: `.dendrita/users/[user-id]/work-modes/user-work-mode.md`

---

## 🔗 Integration with ChatGPT or Other AI

Dendrita can generate optimized prompts based on active context.

**How to use:**
- Ask: "generate the context/prompt to work on X in ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude"
- Context from workspace/project/agent is collected
- A file is generated in `_working-export/` ready to copy/paste

**More details:** `.dendrita/hooks/external-prompt-generator.md`

---

## 📊 Multiple Projects Management

- Use `⚙️ company-management/projects-dashboard.md` per workspace
- Update weekly with status, phase, and upcoming milestones
- Maintain `🤝 stakeholders/` for key relationships and partners

---

## 🎯 ennui Principles (The Compass)

All projects must follow:

- ✅ **Utility over ornamentation:** each deliverable must enable a decision
- ✅ **Honest evidence:** we measure what matters
- ✅ **Collaboration with responsibility:** clear partnerships, simple governance
- ✅ **Continuous learning:** short cycles of testing and adjustment
- ✅ **Public value and business aligned:** impact that strengthens operations and reputation

---

## 🧩 Standards & Style

- For `.dendrita/` components, follow `.dendrita/config-estilo.json`
- For workspace/project files, follow `workspaces/[company]/config-estilo.json`
- Respect lowercase names with hyphens when indicated (e.g., "ennui")
