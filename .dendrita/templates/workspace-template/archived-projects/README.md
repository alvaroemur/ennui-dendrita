# Archived Projects

This folder contains completed projects for the workspace.

## Purpose

Store completed projects here. Projects should be moved here when:
- Project is completed
- Project is cancelled
- Project is on hold indefinitely

## Structure

Same structure as `active-projects/`:
- `master-plan.md` - Project master plan
- `current-context.md` - Final state and decisions
- `tasks.md` - Final task list
- `README.md` - Project documentation (optional)

## Usage

1. Move completed projects from `active-projects/` to `archived-projects/`
2. Update `current-context.md` with final status
3. Document learnings in `README.md` if applicable
