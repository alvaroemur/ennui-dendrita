# Work-Modes for Example User

General work preferences and behavior guidelines.

## What are Work-Modes?

Work-modes define your general work preferences that apply to all sessions. They act as a "system prompt" base that:
- Defines how to ask for context
- Establishes planning preferences
- Sets documentation style
- Configures communication preferences

**Key advantage:** Work-modes ensure **consistent behavior** across all your sessions.
