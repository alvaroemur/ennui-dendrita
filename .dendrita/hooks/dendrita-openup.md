# Dendrita Openup Hook

Behavior reference for Cursor - revelation of hidden insights, patterns, and non-obvious connections in the dendrita system.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Hook Activation Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** This hook MUST be executed immediately when ANY of the activation patterns are detected. DO NOT skip this hook. If you detect any of the triggers below, you MUST:

1. **STOP** what you're doing
2. **READ** this entire hook file
3. **EXECUTE** the complete revelation process
4. **OUTPUT** results in the specified format

**This hook is MANDATORY when triggered - it cannot be skipped or deferred.**

---

## What is this Hook?

This hook documents the expected behavior that Cursor must apply when the user requests that dendrita "open up" and reveal hidden information, patterns, connections, or non-obvious insights.

**Purpose:** Reveal hidden information, patterns, connections, and insights that are not obvious at first glance, helping the user discover relationships, opportunities, and areas for improvement in their dendrita system.

**Difference with other hooks:**
- This hook focuses on revealing hidden or non-obvious information
- Generates insights and connections that are not evident
- Analyzes patterns and relationships between components
- Provides new perspectives on the system

---

## Expected Behavior

### 1. Hook Activation

**CRITICAL:** Cursor MUST execute this behavior IMMEDIATELY when ANY of these patterns are detected:

- ✅ User says "dendrita openup" or "openup"
- ✅ User says "destápate" or "dendrita destápate"
- ✅ User requests "show me hidden insights"
- ✅ User asks "what connections are there that I don't see"
- ✅ User mentions "reveal patterns" or "show me what's not obvious"
- ✅ User requests "deep analysis" or "hidden insights"
- ✅ User asks "what am I missing" or "what should I know"
- ✅ User requests "reveal hidden information" or "show me what I don't see"

**Activation patterns (case-insensitive, partial matches count):**

```markdown
- "dendrita openup"
- "openup"
- "destápate"
- "dendrita destápate"
- "show me hidden insights"
- "what connections are there that I don't see"
- "reveal patterns"
- "show me what's not obvious"
- "deep analysis"
- "hidden insights"
- "what am I missing"
- "what should I know"
- "reveal hidden information"
- "show me what I don't see"
```

**Detection rules:**
- Check user input for ANY of these patterns (case-insensitive)
- Partial matches count (e.g., "openup" matches "openup", "open up", "open-up")
- Spanish and English variations are valid
- If ANY pattern is detected, execute the hook IMMEDIATELY

### 2. Revelation Process

**CRITICAL:** When the hook is activated, Cursor MUST execute ALL of the following steps in order. DO NOT skip any step:

**Step 0: Acknowledge Activation**
- Immediately acknowledge that you're executing the dendrita-openup hook
- Confirm that you understand the request
- Begin the revelation process

When the hook is activated, Cursor must:

#### Step 1: Pattern Analysis (Separate Dev and Work)

**CRITICAL:** Analyze patterns separately for DEV (infrastructure) and WORK (projects):

**DEV (Infrastructure) Analysis:**
```markdown
1. Analyze hooks, skills, agents, and scripts:
   - Hooks not used recently or with issues
   - Skills not used recently
   - Agents without activation in the last period
   - Scripts not executed recently
   - Scripts with errors or problems
   - Automation opportunities
   - Duplicate or redundant scripts
   - Infrastructure components that need attention

2. Analyze infrastructure patterns:
   - Components with old pending updates
   - Infrastructure gaps or missing pieces
   - Optimization opportunities in infrastructure
   - Technical debt or maintenance needs
```

**WORK (Projects) Analysis:**
```markdown
1. Analyze active projects to identify:
   - Projects without recent updates
   - Projects with old pending tasks
   - Projects with stakeholders without recent interaction
   - Projects with objectives without progress

2. Analyze work patterns:
   - Workspaces with low activity
   - Projects with unexploited potential
   - Work dependencies or blockers
   - Collaboration opportunities
```

#### Step 2: Connection Identification (Separate Dev and Work)

**CRITICAL:** Identify connections separately for DEV and WORK:

**DEV (Infrastructure) Connections:**
```markdown
1. Identify connections between infrastructure components:
   - Skills that could be applied to specific projects
   - Agents that could help in current projects
   - Scripts that could automate manual tasks
   - Hooks that could improve workflows
   - Infrastructure dependencies or relationships

2. Identify infrastructure-to-work connections:
   - Skills/agents that could benefit work projects
   - Scripts that could automate work tasks
   - Infrastructure improvements that would help work
```

**WORK (Projects) Connections:**
```markdown
1. Identify connections between projects:
   - Projects with shared stakeholders
   - Projects with related objectives
   - Projects with non-explicit dependencies
   - Synergy opportunities between projects

2. Identify connections between workspaces:
   - Workspaces with related projects
   - Workspaces with shared stakeholders
   - Collaboration opportunities between workspaces
   - Work patterns between workspaces
```

#### Step 3: Insight Generation (Separate Dev and Work)

**CRITICAL:** Generate insights separately for DEV and WORK:

**DEV (Infrastructure) Insights:**
```markdown
1. Generate insights about infrastructure:
   - High activity areas vs. neglected areas in infrastructure
   - Skills/agents usage patterns
   - Script execution patterns
   - Infrastructure optimization opportunities
   - Technical debt or maintenance risks
   - Infrastructure gaps or missing pieces

2. Generate insights about infrastructure components:
   - Components that need attention
   - Components with unexploited potential
   - Infrastructure dependencies or issues
   - Consolidation opportunities in infrastructure
```

**WORK (Projects) Insights:**
```markdown
1. Generate insights about projects:
   - Projects that need attention
   - Projects with unexploited potential
   - Projects with unresolved dependencies
   - Consolidation opportunities

2. Generate insights about stakeholders:
   - Stakeholders without recent interaction
   - Relationship strengthening opportunities
   - Stakeholders with multiple connections
   - Collaboration patterns

3. Generate insights about work patterns:
   - Workspace activity patterns
   - Project lifecycle patterns
   - Work optimization opportunities
```

#### Step 4: Hidden Information Revelation (Separate Dev and Work)

**CRITICAL:** Reveal hidden information separately for DEV and WORK:

**DEV (Infrastructure) Revelations:**
```markdown
1. Reveal non-obvious infrastructure information:
   - Old scripts or hooks that could be useful
   - Forgotten infrastructure improvements
   - Past infrastructure decisions that affect the present
   - Infrastructure components that could be reactivated

2. Reveal infrastructure temporal patterns:
   - Infrastructure development cycles
   - Script execution patterns
   - Infrastructure maintenance patterns

3. Reveal infrastructure opportunities:
   - Infrastructure improvements that would help work
   - Possible automations in infrastructure
   - Recommended infrastructure consolidations
   - Suggested new infrastructure connections
```

**WORK (Projects) Revelations:**
```markdown
1. Reveal non-obvious work information:
   - Archived projects that could be reactivated
   - Old documents with relevant information
   - Forgotten pending tasks
   - Past decisions that affect the present

2. Reveal work temporal patterns:
   - Activity cycles in work
   - High/low productivity periods
   - Seasonal patterns in work
   - Long-term work trends

3. Reveal work opportunities:
   - Projects that could benefit from existing skills/agents
   - Possible automations in work
   - Recommended work consolidations
   - Suggested new work connections
```

### 3. Output Format

**CRITICAL:** The output MUST be divided into DEV and WORK sections. Follow this format:

## Usage Examples

**Example 1:**
**User:** "dendrita openup"

**Cursor must:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** recognize the trigger "openup"
2. **STOP** any current processing
3. **READ** this hook file completely
4. Analyze DEV (infrastructure) patterns separately from WORK (projects)
5. Identify DEV connections and WORK connections separately
6. Generate DEV insights and WORK insights separately
7. Reveal DEV hidden information and WORK hidden information separately
8. Provide actionable DEV recommendations and WORK recommendations
9. Present everything in structured format with DEV and WORK sections clearly separated

**Example 2:**
**User:** "destápate"

**Cursor must:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** recognize the trigger "destápate"
2. **STOP** any current processing
3. **READ** this hook file completely
4. Execute the complete revelation process with DEV and WORK sections separated

**Example 3:**
**User:** "openup"

**Cursor must:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** recognize the trigger "openup" (partial match)
2. **STOP** any current processing
3. **READ** this hook file completely
4. Execute the complete revelation process with DEV and WORK sections separated

## Notes for Cursor

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**

1. **This hook is MANDATORY when triggered** - You cannot skip it or defer it
2. **Check for triggers FIRST** - Before processing any user input, check if it matches any activation pattern
3. **Execute IMMEDIATELY** - When a trigger is detected, stop what you're doing and execute this hook
4. **Complete ALL steps** - Do not skip any step in the revelation process
5. **Use the exact output format** - Follow the specified format precisely
6. **Be thorough** - This is about revealing hidden information, so be comprehensive

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Skipping the hook because you're in the middle of something else
- ❌ Not recognizing partial matches (e.g., "openup" without "dendrita")
- ❌ Not executing all steps of the revelation process
- ❌ Not using the specified output format
- ❌ **Mixing DEV and WORK information** - They MUST be separated into distinct sections
- ❌ **Not analyzing DEV and WORK separately** - Each requires its own analysis
- ❌ Being too brief - this hook requires thorough analysis for both DEV and WORK

**For more information:** See `.dendrita/hooks/list-system-components.md` for components listing, and `.dendrita/hooks/working-context.md` for current work context.
